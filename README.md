This repo holds all of the projects, notes, and write-ups I have done while completing the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/cybersecurity/#?modal_active=none).

You can view my certificate of completion on [Credly](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/8fb5d86d-0caf-4bb5-ba83-815ba1d4217e) or [Coursera](https://coursera.org/share/7a601563eb8f4fbe2f7bcd32199ef18c).

In this course I gained foundational knowledge that will prepare me for entry-level jobs in cybersecurity and help me understand how security teams protect their organizations and its customers. 

This course covered many conceptual topics such as:
  * Risk management
  * Threat analysis
  * Network security
  * Incident response

It also taught me technical skills with:
  * Linux
  * Python
  * SQL
  * SIEM tools (Splunk and Chronicle)
  * Network protocol analyzers (Wireshark and tcpdump)
  * IDS/IPS tools
  * Firewalls
